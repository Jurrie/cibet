call the servlet with http://localhost:8788/cibetJMeter/?loops=100&amp;test=calc&amp;param2=100<br>
where 'test' is the name of one of the test methods<br> 
and 'loops' is the number of loops that are executed within the method<br>
and 'param2' is used only in some methods<br><br>
<h2>Test methods</h2>
<h3>Setpoint SP1-servletFilter</h3>
calc - executes a Math calculation in a loop<br>
calc2 - same as calc, but irregularly sleeps before looping. This allows different offsets of multi threaded requests. param2 is the sleep time in ms<br>
io - writes into a file in a loop. Each thread writes into an own file<br>
ioLog - an info message is written with log4j in a loop. On each loop, the thread sleeps for param2 ms.<br>
ioLogLocal - same as io, but sleeps in each loop for param2 ms<br>
mem - a String is added to a list in a loop<br>
mem2 - a long String is added to a list in a loop. In each loop some elements of the list are replaced as food for garbage collection<br>

<b>Synchronized:</b><br>
syncCalc - same as calc, but as synchronized method<br> 
syncIo - same as calc, but as synchronized method<br>
calcSync - replaces a value in a synchronized map in a loop<br>
calcSync2 - arbitrarily either calls calcSync or increases a counter depending on param2 which must be between 0 and 1. If param2 = 0, 
always the counter is increased, if param2 = 1 always calcSync is called.<br>           
ioSync - an info message is written with log4j in a loop<br>
ioSync2 - arbitrarily either calls ioSync or writes into a file in a loop depending on param2 which must be between 0 and 1. If param2 = 0, 
always writes into a file, if param2 = 1 always ioSync is called. Each thread has an own file.<br>
 
<h3>Setpoint SP2-javaMethod</h3>
cibetCalc - like calc<br>
cibetIo - like io<br>
cibetMem - like mem<br>
cibetMem2 - like mem2<br>
cibetCalcSync - like calcSync<br>
cibetIoSync - like ioSync<br>
syncCibetCalc - like cibetCalc but synchronized<br>
syncCibetIo - like cibetIo but synchronized<br>
